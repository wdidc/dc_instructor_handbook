# Weekly Planning

- First draft of lesson plan is submitted 24 hours prior to delivery
- Lesson plan reviews 12 hours prior to delivery
- Learning objectives are agreed upon before Thursday @ 6pm
- Time is scheduled on Friday for monday lecturers to prepare.

## Reviewing Lesson Plans

It will be **your responsibility** to find at least one person to review your lesson plan.
Once you've found a partner, please create a Trello card and assign it to your partner
asking them to review your lesson plan.

Jesse will be the caboose to make sure every lesson plan has been reviewed at least
once before delivery.

## Getting Help

Jesse wants you to struggle a little bit.

Struggling includes but is not limited to:

- needing to create solutions for exercises
- creating exercises that don't yet exist
- unsure about exercises to give
- unsure about particular parts of lesson delivery

If at any point you feel like you
need help and the student experience will suffer, please @mention jshawl with a :siren:
