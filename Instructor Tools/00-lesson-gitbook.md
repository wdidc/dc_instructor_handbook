# Lesson GitBook (our textbook)

We are creating a compendium of our lessons, formatted as a [gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook).

## Process

When you push your changes to github, a post-commit hook will
generate a new gitbook, using SUMMARY.md as a manifest.  Only those files listed in SUMMARY.md will be referenced.

## Pro Tips

- You may want to review your changes before publishing/pushing.  You can render the gitbook locally, by following instructions in [gitbook project](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook).

## GitHub (commit hooks) setup
