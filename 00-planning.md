# Planning for a New Cohort

> At this exact moment, there are WDIs happening in 14 cities, with over 80 instructors teaching simultaneously.

## Introduction

When we were a smaller operation, we started by planning on-the-fly, and we ended up recreating the wheel a lot of times. We learned a lot, made a lot of mistakes, but it was hard for us to stay in touch with what everyone else was doing, let alone catalog our work in a reusable way.

Since then, we've developed a shared terminology and a well-defined planning process, making it possible to share knowledge among our network of talented instructors.

This planning process is outlined in this document, and each team will be asked to follow this process when crafting the course plan for each cohort. By committing to do this, we can work better together, deliver a consistent level of quality to our students, and share knowledge globally.

## Objectives

After following this process, you will:

- have gotten up to speed on the global state-of-the-WDI-union
- reviewed the course projects your city is currently teaching
- have identified real objectives & goals that build up to the course projects
- feel prepared to deliver a course you're confident is in line with what we advertise
- be able to focus more on preparing the actual content of what you're going to teach

## Plan Ahead

**Schedule time.**  This process takes several days, and you should follow it with your entire instructional team. Preferably block off the entire week leading up to your next cohort, put it on the calendar, and send out invites.

## The Planning Process

1. [**Review and discuss**](#step-1-review-and-discuss-the-curriculum-guidelines) the curriculum guidelines
2. [**Plan**](#step-2-plan-your-weekly-units-in-trello) your weekly units in Trello
3. [**Kickoff**](#step-3-kickoff-a-weekly-team-workflow) a weekly team workflow

### Step 1: Review and discuss the curriculum guidelines

Review and read through each of the following documents, and take time to discuss the associated discussion questions.


#### ★ Review the [Curriculum Framework](../00-product-overview/03-curriculum.md)

  - Are there any things that are unclear?

  - Are there any questions about the expectations for our team?


#### ★ Review the [Project Specs](../../curriculum/projects)

  - How can we streamline the lessons we're going to teach to focus on reaching these learning goals?

  - Do we need to adjust these project specs to provide any additional guidance for struggling students, or optional challenges for advanced students?


#### ★ Review the [Themes and Core Competencies](../../curriculum/competencies.md)

  - Do we lack confidence to teach any of these topics?

  - What additional competencies would we want want to add if we have time?


#### ★ Review our default [Languages and Frameworks](../../curriculum/technologies-global.md)

  - Which of the default technologies have we never taught before?

  - What technologies do we need to brush up on prior to teaching?

  - Are there any adjustments we think we need to make to these technologies? If so discuss with your team lead and make sure to follow the process for documenting these differences.

## Step 2: Plan your weekly units in Trello

#### Introduction

> **[Trello Planner](https://trello.com/wdip)**:  We use Trello for pre-course planning and ongoing collaboration.

While all students should get to experience largely the same **scope** of learning objectives and **sequence** of projects, they won't all get to their goal in the exact same way. Your creativity as teachers gets to shine as you tackle the hardest part of the process – actually mapping lessons to weeks & days. This is what we call a **course plan.**

It's important that by the time we start a new cohort, each team has a full course plan roughly mapped out. This can take a lot of time, so we strongly recommend that you use either the Baseline Curriculum or an existing course plan from a previous cohort in your market.  

#### Why Trello?

We searched far and wide for the perfect tool that would let us organize index cards for each lesson and map them by day, week, and unit. We've found that the best tool to tackle all of those in an easy-to-use and fairly flexible way is [Trello](https://trello.com/), which many of our teams have been using for some time.

Once you've been invited to the **[GA: WDI Planner](https://trello.com/wdip)** organization on Trello (ask someone on your team to invite you), you'll have access to all of our global Trello course plans, including the Baseline Curriculum.

#### ★ Create your board

For each new cohort, your producer or city lead will make a new board (normally by copying an existing one).

***To get started:***

1. Go to the **[GA: WDI Planner](https://trello.com/wdip) organization**
2. Open up the board you want to copy
3. Go to the menu sidebar and choose **Copy Board...**
4. **Set the title** to be ``\{{Market Code\}} - WDI #\{{Cohort Number\}}``, e.g.
  - ``LA - WDI #16``
  - ``NY - WDI #129``
  - ``LDN - WDI #14``

5. Set the **organization** to be **GA: WDI Planner**.
6. **Keep ``✓ Keep Cards`` checked.**

**Save it!** You'll be automatically transported to your new cohort planner. If all of your team isn't invited as a member to the board, invite your team now.

#### ★ Confirm holidays and breaks

Working with your producer, add cards for holidays, breaks, or important campus events. Put due dates on them so they show up on the right place in the calendar.

> Note: All courses should have 57 scheduled days, and should plan for 3 days off during the 12 weeks of WDI. If there are more than 3 actual holidays during the course term, your producer will take point on scheduling make up days.

#### ★ Scaffold your lessons, labs, and assignments

Each unit has 10 days of learning content, followed by up to one week of dedicated project time. Check out the [Baseline Curriculum](https://trello.com/b/TuQiadjV/wdi-2-0-baseline) to see this in action.

Each week should have about 40 hours of content. On average, we recommend:

- **1 hour** morning exercise to kick off the day, which normally reviews the homework from the evening before. On Fridays, we recommend you give a quiz instead (some instructors prefer to give quizzes daily).

- **2.5 hours** of instructor-led lesson content, which normally involves a code-along. In the Baseline Curriculum, we normally split this time into 2 smaller blocks of an hour and 15 mins.

- **2.5 hours** of in-class lab time, which can be group or individual work. In the Baseline Curriculum, we normally split this time into 2 smaller blocks of an hour and 15 mins.

- **~2 hours** of evening activities (code challenges, mini-projects, or study material)

Before your course begins, you should have all of these blocks modeled out in your course plan, and as much as possible, make sure that each card has at least a checklist of learning objectives.

> **Pro tip:** You can add cards directly to the calendar by enabling the Calendar power-up and switching to calendar view.


#### ★ Add some initial detail to each "index card"

- The **title** of each card should hold the name of the lesson, lab, or assignment
- Add a **label** to indicate the type of activity (lesson, lab, or after hours assignment, generally)
- Add another **label** corresponding to the [theme](../../curriculum/competencies.md) of the lesson
- Create two **checklists**
  - *Learning Objectives* should contain – you guessed it – actual learning objectives. You'll tighten these up when you sit down to finish planning this lesson, but should make sure to have an initial set of objectives now.
  - *Essential Questions* should be specific questions we can use to assess whether this session achieved its objectives, and whether students _got_ it.

>  As you review the Baseline and other teams' course plans, you'll find a lot of really well-worded objectives you can re-use. You can also hop on Slack and start asking in the #wdi-instructors channel how other markets are teaching certain topics, and whether they have any recommendations.


#### ★ Add due dates and times

You'll probably find that you'll toggle between calendar view and standard view as you work in Trello. You may not know exactly when each lesson will fall, and you'll adjust the specific dates and times as you work through the course.

Click the calendar button in the top right to see a schedule view based on the due dates of your cards. If you're working off of a copy of another board, recognize that you'll need to update due dates on all the cards in order to "place" them on the right day in the calendar view.

> **Pro tip:** Download [this Chrome extension](https://github.com/micahbrich/ga-trello) to make calendar view look more like a real calendar.


> Following this process for each lesson is hard, and will probably take several days, but it will pay off in the long run. It is strongly recommended that you try to re-use a lot of the learning objectives from the Baseline Curriculum or other course plans, and pick one or two key areas that you want to really try to improve or build new content for this cohort. **Don't recreate the wheel if you don't have to!**

## Step 3: Kickoff a weekly team workflow

After your cohort _starts_, you should continue to use your Trello board to plan, document, and organize your curriculum. We've found Friday afternoons are generally a good time to have students working on a lab and have instructors out of the classroom, for both planning and professional development.

During this time, instructors will:

- reflect on the week
- revisit next week's plan
- call dibs on lessons for next week

#### ★ Assign lessons

When you decide who's teaching what, use the "members" feature on the card to assign specific lessons and labs to team members.

#### ★ Plan your lessons

You won't have all of your lessons ready before the course starts – you need to work with your producer to reserve planning time throughout each week to step out of the classroom to plan lessons for the next day.

When you start planning for a particular lesson or lab, you should already have the learning objectives roughly defined. The next step is to outline a bit more detail for the lesson, following the recommended [style guide](../../curriculum/styleguide.md) template.

Lesson planning may involve writing new content, or (often) revising existing materials. Try to get your planning done during the day and reserve your evenings for your own rest – it's hard, but necessary, to make sure you unplug at the end of the day and re-energize.

Always remember to **store your materials** in this repository and then **add a link** to the _Description_ section in the associated Trello card.

#### ★ Reflect on your lesson

Immediately after teaching a lesson or facilitating a lab, take 5 minutes to do a quick "delta plus" activity and write some notes in the lesson's Trello card.

- **Delta (Δ)**:  What would I change about this lesson next time? What didn't go over well?
- **Plus (+)**:  What went well? Which parts of the lesson did students connect with particularly well? Where were the "aha" moments?
