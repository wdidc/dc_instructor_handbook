# Kicking Off a New Cohort

> When kicking off your cohort, you have an opportunity to set your classroom culture and begin your class with a boost of morale and energy. It's also an important time to help your class bond, set expectations, and make sure students know who's who at GA.

The first component of kicking off WDI takes place during the week leading up to the start of a course, normally on **Friday or Saturday before class**. During this time, we get everyone together (insructors, producers, and students) and cover [orientation](#orientation) and [installfest](#installfest).

## Orientation

Producers lead a presentation and discussion around:

- Class & Space Rundown
- The GA Team
- Make the Most of Your Course
- Immersive Success
- Our Values & Commitments
- Prework Status Check
- Demo of GA Mentors
- Installfest

This should take about 30-40 minutes, after which we go straight into [Installfest](#installfest).

## Installfest

At Installfest, we make sure everyone has their dev environment setup. Instructors lead this time, and it can take anywhere from 1-3 hours. Normally students leave as soon as they confirm their computer is set up.

The second part of kicking off your course takes place on **Day 1 of Class** (normally Monday). This is a chance to set expectations on the academic arc, learning goals, and details of the student experience.

## Your Learning Experience

This presentation is led by instructors during the first day of class. There's a little bit of overlap with orientation, in that we do a group bonding and introductions activity again, but this presentation is more focused on:

- Icebreakers
- Expectations & Ground Rules
- WDI Learning Experience
